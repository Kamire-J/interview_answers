# Programming Approach
## Recursive
### Advantages
* Simplicity when it comes to implementation, which also makes it easy to understand.
* It is good for small values or in cases where recursion depth is not a major concern.
### Disadvantages
* Inefficiency increases with increase in input value. 
* Potential increase in memory utilization because of the additional function overhead.

## Iterative Approach
### Advantages
* It is good for large input values.
* In comparison to the recursive approach, iterative uses less memory.
### Disadvantages
* The implementation is relatively complex.
* Some people might find this approach less intuitive.

## Dynamic Programming
### Advantages
* Good for large input values because repeated calculations are shunned.
* Optimization focuses on speed and memory utilization.
* Access to previously calculated values is taken into account.

### Limitations
* Uses additional memory to store values that have been computed.
* Dynamic programming is complex compared to the recursive approach.
